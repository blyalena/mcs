    <p><strong>Chris (born 17 July 1983, surname unknown) is an anonymous cartoonist known for his comedic and deliberately<br>
    childlike caricatures and stream-of-consciousness writing. Chris has stated that he was first inspired to draw characters<br>
    from The Simpsons when he was five, around the time the show first went to air. He still caricatures fictional characters<br>
    such as the cast of The Simpsons, and signs each of his comments with the qualifier "(Simpsons artist)".<br>
    He is also known for caricaturing real people currently at the centre of the media's attention.<br><br>
    As a result of his cult following, Chris is a regular contributor to NME, FHM, Front, The Independent, and The Guardian.<br>
    His career and style were summarised by FHM as<br>
    <em>"he's the Internet's Picasso, he lives in Scotland somewhere, no one knows<br>
    his real name, and he does slightly unnerving pictures of famous people".</em><br>
    In 2011, Front praised Chris for what they described as his <em>"so-bad-they're-actually-bloody-amazingly-good illustrations"</em>.<br>
    In May 2012, a selection of Chris' artwork was displayed at the IG:LU art gallery in Inverness.<br><br>

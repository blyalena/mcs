    <p><strong>Chris (born 17 July 1983, surname unknown) is an anonymous cartoonist known for his comedic and deliberately
    childlike caricatures and stream-of-consciousness writing. Chris has stated that he was first inspired to draw characters
    from The Simpsons when he was five, around the time the show first went to air. He still caricatures fictional characters
    such as the cast of The Simpsons, and signs each of his comments with the qualifier "(Simpsons artist)".
    He is also known for caricaturing real people currently at the centre of the media's attention.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>As a result of his cult following, Chris is a regular contributor to NME, FHM, Front, The Independent, and The Guardian.
    His career and style were summarised by FHM as
    <em>"he's the Internet's Picasso, he lives in Scotland somewhere, no one knows
    his real name, and he does slightly unnerving pictures of famous people".</em>
    In 2011, Front praised Chris for what they described as his <em>"so-bad-they're-actually-bloody-amazingly-good illustrations"</em>.
    In May 2012, a selection of Chris' artwork was displayed at the IG:LU art gallery in Inverness.</strong></p>
